## Chapter 01. Introduction to Networking

A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to
transmit information via any variation of a physical quantity.

The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery
methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

The information exchanged between devices through a network or other media is governed by rules and conventions that can
be set out in communication protocol specifications.

These specifications, define the nature of communication, the actual data exchanged and any state-dependent behaviors.

In digital computing systems, the rules can be expressed by algorithms and data structures.

**Protocols** are to **communication** what **algorithms** or programming languages are to **computations**.

To implement a **networking protocol**, the protocol software modules are interfaced with a framework implemented on the
machine's operating system. This framework implements the networking functionality of the operating system.

When protocol algorithms are expressed in a portable programming language, the protocol software may be made operating
system independent. The best-known frameworks are the **TCP/IP model** and the **OSI model**.

**Types of communication protocols**

There are **two** types of communication protocols, based on their representation of the content being carried:

- **Text-based**: A text-based protocol or plain text protocol represents its content in human-readable format,
  often in plain text encoded in a machine-readable encoding such as `ASCII` or `UTF-8`, or in structured text-based
  formats such as `XML` or `JSON`.
  Examples: **FTP**, **SMTP**, **HTTP** (earlier versions), **Finger Protocol**

- **Binary**: A binary protocol utilizes all values of a `byte`, as opposed to a text-based protocol which only uses
  values corresponding to human-readable characters in `ASCII` encoding. Binary protocols are intended to be read by a
  machine rather than a human being. Binary protocols have the advantage of terseness, which translates into speed of
  transmission and interpretation.
  Examples: **HTTP/2**, **HTTP/3**, **EbXML**, **EDOC**

### TCP/IP model

The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols
used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria.

The foundational protocols in the suite are:

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- Internet Protocol (IP)

Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (A and B) connected by a link between their respective
routers.

The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each
other by some kind of data pipe.

After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying
principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers.

In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data
structures and the connecting routers, while at the inter-networking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed
at each router.

**_Layer 1 - Data Link_**

The data link layer defines the networking methods within the scope of the **local network** link on which hosts
communicate without intervening **routers**.

This layer includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to affect the
transmission of internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts.

For example, Ethernet protocol wraps the data into dataframes and uses machines MAC addresses to deliver data frames.

To summarize,

- Physical delivery of data over a single link
- In charge of:
    - encapsulation of data
    - flow control
    - error detection and correction, etc.
- Examples: Ethernet, 802.11 (Wi-Fi), ARP, RAPR, NDP, PPP, etc.

**_Layer 2 - Internet_**

The internet layer exchanges **datagrams** across network boundaries.

It provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) of the underlying network
connections.

It is therefore also the layer that establishes inter-networking. Indeed, it defines and establishes the **Internet**.

This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite.

The primary protocol in this scope is the **Internet Protocol**, which defines **IP addresses**.

Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next host, functioning as an IP router, that has the
connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.

**_Layer 3 - Transport_**

The transport layer performs host-to-host communications on either the local network or remote networks separated by
**routers**.

It provides a channel for the communication needs of applications.

There are two main protocols in the transport layer:

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** provides flow-control, connection establishment, and reliable transmission of
  data:
    - Reliable - guarantees data delivery as sent, without any losses
    - Connection between 2 points needs to be created before data is sent and should be shut down in the end
    - Works as a streaming interface - stream of bytes flowing through the dedicated connection

- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** provides an unreliable connectionless datagram service:
    - Connectionless
    - Best effort - unreliable
    - Messages can be lost, duplicated or re-ordered
    - Based on a unit called _Datagram_ which is limited in size
    - Allows multicasting and broadcasting

**_Layer 4 - Application_**

The application layer is the scope within which **applications**, or **processes**, create user data and communicate
this data to other applications on another or the same host.

The applications make use of the services provided by the underlying lower layers, especially the **transport layer**
which provides reliable or unreliable pipes to other processes.

The communications partners are characterized by the application architecture, such as the clientâ€“server model and
peer-to-peer networking. This is the layer in which all application protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, operate.

Processes are addressed via ports which essentially represent services.
